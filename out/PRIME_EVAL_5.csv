Explanation: 

To determine if 17077 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number. 

17077 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd number up to the square root of 17077 (which is approximately 130.7). 

We can see that it is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, or any other odd number up to 130.7. 

Therefore, 17077 is a prime number.",4.291574717,0.000374,20230702,"07/02/2023, 21:28:40"

Explanation: 

To determine if 18367 is a prime number, we need to check if it is only divisible by 1 and itself. 

We can start by checking if it is divisible by 2. If it is, then it is not a prime number. 

18367 is an odd number, so it is not divisible by 2. 

Next, we can check if it is divisible by any odd number up to the square root of 18367. 

The square root of 18367 is approximately 135.6, so we only need to check if it is divisible by any odd number up to 135. 

We can see that it is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, or 131. 

Therefore, 18367 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself, and it is a prime number.",6.719150782,0.00059,20230702,"07/02/2023, 21:28:40"

Step by step explanation: 

1. Check if the number is even. If it is, then it is not a prime number. 
- 19997 is odd, so we move on to the next step. 

2. Check if the number is divisible by any prime number less than or equal to the square root of the number. 
- The square root of 19997 is approximately 141.4. 
- We check if 19997 is divisible by any prime number less than or equal to 141.4. 
- We find that it is not divisible by 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 127, or 131. 
- Therefore, we can conclude that 19997 is not divisible by any prime number less than or equal to its square root. 

3. Therefore, we can conclude that 19997 is a prime number.",7.738648176,0.00059,20230702,"07/02/2023, 21:28:40"

Step by step: 

1. Check if 7253 is divisible by 2. Since 7253 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. 
2. Check if 7253 is divisible by any odd number between 3 and the square root of 7253 (which is approximately 85). 
   - 7253 is not divisible by 3 (7+2+5+3 = 17, which is not divisible by 3). 
   - 7253 is not divisible by 5 (the last digit is not 0 or 5). 
   - 7253 is not divisible by 7 (we can use long division or a calculator to check). 
   - We can stop here because we have checked all odd numbers between 3 and 85. 
3. Therefore, 7253 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is a prime number. 
4. To confirm whether 7253 is prime, we would need to check all prime numbers between 2 and the square root of 7253. However, we already know that 7253 is not divisible by any odd number between 3 and 85, so it is highly unlikely that it is divisible by any prime number between 2 and 85. 
5. Therefore, we can conclude that 7253 is not a prime number.",10.67071724,0.000662,20230702,"07/02/2023, 21:28:40"

Step by step explanation: 

1. Check if the number is divisible by 2. If yes, then it is not a prime number. 
- 13177 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2. 

2. Check if the number is divisible by any odd number up to the square root of the number. 
- The square root of 13177 is approximately 114.8. 
- Checking odd numbers up to 11 (the next odd number after 7) shows that none of them divide evenly into 13177. 

3. Therefore, 13177 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 
- However, this does not necessarily mean that it is a prime number. 

4. To confirm whether 13177 is prime, we would need to check all odd numbers up to its square root. 
- This is not practical to do by hand, but using a computer program or online calculator, we can find that 13177 is actually divisible by 37 and 359.
