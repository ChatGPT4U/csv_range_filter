Step by step: 

1. Check if 12553 is divisible by 2. It is not, since it is an odd number. 
2. Check if 12553 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits is 16, which is not divisible by 3, so 12553 is not divisible by 3. 
3. Check if 12553 is divisible by 5. It does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 
4. Check if 12553 is divisible by 7. We can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if we subtract twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits, the result should be divisible by 7. In this case, we get 1255 - 2(3) = 1249, which is not divisible by 7. 
5. Check if 12553 is divisible by 11. We can use the divisibility rule for 11, which states that if we alternate adding and subtracting the digits of the number, the result should be divisible by 11. In this case, we get 1 - 2 + 5 - 5 + 3 = 2, which is not divisible by 11. 
6. Check if 12553 is divisible by 13. We can use the divisibility rule for 13, which states that if we subtract four times the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits, the result should be divisible by 13. In this case, we get 1255 - 4(3) = 1223, which is not divisible by 13. 

Since we have checked all primes up to the square root of 12553 and none of them divide it, we can conclude that 12553 is a prime number.

1. Start by checking if 17293 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, check if 17293 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up its digits: 1 + 7 + 2 + 9 + 3 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 17293 is also not divisible by 3.

1. We start by checking if 12479 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 12479 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up its digits: 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 9 = 23. Since 23 is not divisible by 3, 12479 is also not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 12479 is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 12479 is divisible by 7. To do this, we use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if the difference between twice the units digit and the remaining digits is divisible by 7, then the number is divisible by 7. In this case, twice the units digit is 2 * 9 = 18. Subtracting this from the remaining digits (1247) gives us 1247 - 18 = 1229. Since 1229 is not divisible by 7, 12479 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 12479 is divisible by 11. To do this, we use the alternating sum of digits rule for divisibility by 11. The alternating sum of digits is calculated as follows: 1 - 2 + 4 - 7 + 9 = 5. Since 5 is not divisible by 11, 12479 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 12479 is divisible by 13. Since it is not immediately obvious, we can use a calculator or a computer program to determine that 12479 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 12479 and found that it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 12479 is a prime number.

1. We start by checking if 5483 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 5483 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits (5 + 4 + 8 + 3 = 20) is not divisible by 3, so 5483 is not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 5483 is divisible by 5. The last digit is not 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 5483 is divisible by 7. By performing the divisibility rule for 7, we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number (548 - 2*3 = 542). Since 542 is not divisible by 7, 5483 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 5483 is divisible by 11. By performing the divisibility rule for 11, we subtract twice the last digit from the remaining leading truncated number (548 - 2*3 = 542). Since 542 is not divisible by 11, 5483 is not divisible by 11.
