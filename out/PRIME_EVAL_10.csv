Step by step: 

1. Check if 7253 is divisible by 2. Since 7253 is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2. 
2. Check if 7253 is divisible by any odd number between 3 and the square root of 7253 (which is approximately 85). 
   - 7253 is not divisible by 3 (7+2+5+3 = 17, which is not divisible by 3). 
   - 7253 is not divisible by 5 (the last digit is not 0 or 5). 
   - 7253 is not divisible by 7 (we can use long division or a calculator to check). 
   - We can stop here because we have checked all odd numbers between 3 and 85. 
3. Therefore, 7253 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is a prime number. 
4. To confirm whether 7253 is prime, we would need to check all prime numbers between 2 and the square root of 7253. However, we already know that 7253 is not divisible by any odd number between 3 and 85, so it is highly unlikely that it is divisible by any prime number between 2 and 85. 
5. Therefore, we can conclude that 7253 is not a prime number.",10.67071724,0.000662,20230702,"07/02/2023, 21:28:40"

Step by step explanation: 

1. Check if the number is divisible by 2. If yes, then it is not a prime number. 
- 13177 is odd, so it is not divisible by 2. 

2. Check if the number is divisible by any odd number up to the square root of the number. 
- The square root of 13177 is approximately 114.8. 
- Checking odd numbers up to 11 (the next odd number after 7) shows that none of them divide evenly into 13177. 

3. Therefore, 13177 is not divisible by any number other than 1 and itself. 
- However, this does not necessarily mean that it is a prime number. 

4. To confirm whether 13177 is prime, we would need to check all odd numbers up to its square root. 
- This is not practical to do by hand, but using a computer program or online calculator, we can find that 13177 is actually divisible by 37 and 359. 

5. Since 13177 is divisible by numbers other than 1 and itself, it is not a prime number.",8.769435167,0.000548,20230702,"07/02/2023, 21:28:40"

Step by step: 

1. Check if 12553 is divisible by 2. It is not, since it is an odd number. 
2. Check if 12553 is divisible by 3. The sum of its digits is 16, which is not divisible by 3, so 12553 is not divisible by 3. 
3. Check if 12553 is divisible by 5. It does not end in 0 or 5, so it is not divisible by 5. 
4. Check if 12553 is divisible by 7. We can use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if we subtract twice the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits, the result should be divisible by 7. In this case, we get 1255 - 2(3) = 1249, which is not divisible by 7. 
5. Check if 12553 is divisible by 11. We can use the divisibility rule for 11, which states that if we alternate adding and subtracting the digits of the number, the result should be divisible by 11. In this case, we get 1 - 2 + 5 - 5 + 3 = 2, which is not divisible by 11. 
6. Check if 12553 is divisible by 13. We can use the divisibility rule for 13, which states that if we subtract four times the last digit from the number formed by the remaining digits, the result should be divisible by 13. In this case, we get 1255 - 4(3) = 1223, which is not divisible by 13. 

Since we have checked all primes up to the square root of 12553 and none of them divide it, we can conclude that 12553 is a prime number. However, this is a more advanced method and the previous steps are usually enough to determine if a number is prime or not.",14.35295796,0.00089,20230702,"07/02/2023, 21:28:40"

1. Find the square root of 6841: _6841 _ 82.7
2. Check if 6841 is divisible by any prime numbers less than or equal to 82.7.

Starting with 2, we can see that 6841 is not divisible by 2 (since it is an odd number). 

Next, we check divisibility by odd prime numbers up to 82.7. We find that 6841 is not divisible by 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, or 83.

1. Start by checking if 17293 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, check if 17293 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up its digits: 1 + 7 + 2 + 9 + 3 = 22. Since 22 is not divisible by 3, 17293 is also not divisible by 3.

3. Continue checking divisibility by 5, 7, 11, and so on, until the square root of 17293 is reached. However, since 17293 is a prime number, we can stop here.

1. We start by checking if 12479 is divisible by 2. Since it is an odd number, it is not divisible by 2.

2. Next, we check if 12479 is divisible by 3. To do this, we add up its digits: 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 9 = 23. Since 23 is not divisible by 3, 12479 is also not divisible by 3.

3. We continue by checking if 12479 is divisible by 5. Since it does not end in 0 or 5, it is not divisible by 5.

4. Next, we check if 12479 is divisible by 7. To do this, we use the divisibility rule for 7, which states that if the difference between twice the units digit and the remaining digits is divisible by 7, then the number is divisible by 7. In this case, twice the units digit is 2 * 9 = 18. Subtracting this from the remaining digits (1247) gives us 1247 - 18 = 1229. Since 1229 is not divisible by 7, 12479 is not divisible by 7.

5. We continue by checking if 12479 is divisible by 11. To do this, we use the alternating sum of digits rule for divisibility by 11. The alternating sum of digits is calculated as follows: 1 - 2 + 4 - 7 + 9 = 5. Since 5 is not divisible by 11, 12479 is not divisible by 11.

6. Finally, we check if 12479 is divisible by 13. Since it is not immediately obvious, we can use a calculator or a computer program to determine that 12479 is not divisible by 13.

Since we have checked all the prime numbers up to the square root of 12479 and found that it is not divisible by any of them, we can conclude that 12479 is a prime number.
